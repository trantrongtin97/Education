=========================================================================================================== Asp.Net Core View Component
View Components are used to create reusable components that can encapsulate rendering logic and data fetching logic independently from views, 
and they can be called from different places like from Controller action methods, from views, and from Razor Pages. They are similar to partial views, 
but they can have their own logic, making them suitable for creating dynamic content that requires processing.

View Components consist of two main parts: the class that handles processing and logic and the result it returns, which is typically a view (rendered HTML). 
They are ideal for scenarios where you need to display information that requires some business logic to fetch or generate the displayed data, 
such as dynamic navigation menus,a shopping cart, or user profile summaries.

View Component bao gôm 2 file:
	- Server-Side File (.cs file): Contains the logic to retrieve or prepare data.
	- Client Side File (.cshtml file): Renders the output, similar to how a partial view works.

Location for the files of view component
	- Server-Side File (.cs file): Any where with any name at ROOT LEVEL of the project and pull all them in folder
	- Client-Side File (.cshtml):
		Location 1: Call from controler'action method
			 /Views/{Controller Name}/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
		Location 2: Call from other cshtml file
			/Views/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}
		Location 3: Using in Razor pages
			/Pages/Shared/Components/{View Component Name}/{View Name}

Note: Recommended naming of view component is Default.cshtml
